Python solutions to App Academy's (a/A) practice problems.

Prior to a bootcamp applicant's first coding interview, a/A recommends these
exercises as an introduction to programming concepts for those new to coding.

In the Spring of 2016, I applied for App Academy, but unfortunately 
did not make it pass the third and final phase. However, I've recently started
learning Python and decided to work through these problems again as practice.

Although App Academy's prep materials, problems, and currciculum are desinged 
in Ruby, you're permitted to answer their challenges in any programming 
language.
